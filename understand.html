            Older adults want to play active and meaningful roles in their lives, including as part of a social
            network, a neighborhood, and a community. Service providers and policymakers must consider that a lack
            of sense of purpose can become problematic as people age. Engaging them in leisure activities and
            volunteer work is important.

            Older adults want to stay active and contribute to society in a reciprocal manner (meaning that they
            want to exchange their services and skills with others for the mutual benefit of the neighborhood or
            community). Qualitative and quantitative studies published from 2005 to 2016 examining the social needs
            of older adults were eligible for inclusion.

            To stimulate social contacts, neighborhood initiatives can be developed. Social meeting places, such as
            pubs and churches can help to foster the development of close and peripheral relationships.
